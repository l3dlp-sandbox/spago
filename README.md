> Currently, the main branch contains version v1, which differs substantially from version [v0.7](https://github.com/nlpodyssey/spago/tree/v0.7.0). For NLP-related features, check out the [Cybertron](https://github.com/nlpodyssey/cybertron) package!
> The [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/nlpodyssey/spago/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) details the major changes.

A **Machine Learning** library written in pure Go designed to support relevant neural architectures in **Natural
Language Processing**.

Spago is self-contained, in that it uses its own lightweight computational graph both for training and
inference, easy to understand from start to finish. 

It provides:
- Automatic differentiation via dynamic define-by-run execution
- Gradient descent optimizers (Adam, RAdam, RMS-Prop, AdaGrad, SGD)
- Feed-forward layers (Linear, Highway, Convolution...)
- Recurrent layers (LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM...)
- Attention layers (Self-Attention, Multi-Head Attention...)
- Memory-efficient Word Embeddings (with [badger](https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger) keyâ€“value store)
- Gob compatible neural models for serialization

## Usage

Requirements:

* [Go 1.19](https://golang.org/dl/)

Clone this repo or get the library:

```console
go get -u github.com/nlpodyssey/spago
```

### Dependencies

The core [module](https://github.com/nlpodyssey/spago/blob/v1.0.0-alpha.0/go.mod) of Spago relies only on [testify](github.com/stretchr/testify) for unit testing. 
In other words, it has "zero dependencies", and we are committed to keeping it that way as much as possible.

Spago uses a multi-module [workspace](https://github.com/nlpodyssey/spago/blob/v1.0.0-alpha.0/go.work) to ensure that additional dependencies are downloaded only when specific features (e.g. persistent embeddings) are used.

### Getting Started

A good place to start is by looking at the implementation of built-in neural models, such as the LSTM.
Except for a few linear algebra operations written in assembly for optimal performance (a bit of copying from [Gonum](https://github.com/gonum/gonum)), it's straightforward Go code, so you don't have to worry. In fact, SpaGO could have been written by you :)

The behavior of a neural model is characterized by a combination of parameters and equations. 
Mathematical expressions must be defined using the auto-grad `ag` package in order to take advantage of automatic differentiation.

In this sense, we can say the computational graph is at the center of the Spago machine learning framework.

### Example 1
Here is an example of how to calculate the sum of two variables:

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"

  "github.com/nlpodyssey/spago/ag"
  "github.com/nlpodyssey/spago/mat"
)

type T = float32

func main() {
  // create a new node of type variable with a scalar
  a := mat.Scalar(T(2.0), mat.WithGrad(true)) // create another node of type variable with a scalar
  b := mat.Scalar(T(5.0), mat.WithGrad(true)) // create an addition operator (the calculation is actually performed here)
  c := ag.Add(a, b)

  // print the result
  fmt.Printf("c = %v (float%d)\n", c.Value(), c.Value().Scalar().BitSize())

  c.AccGrad(mat.Scalar(T(0.5)))
  ag.Backward(c)
  fmt.Printf("ga = %v\n", a.Grad())
  fmt.Printf("gb = %v\n", b.Grad())
}
```

Output:

```console
c = [7] (float32)
ga = [0.5]
gb = [0.5]
```

### Example 2

Here is a simple implementation of the perceptron formula:

```go
package main

import (
  . "github.com/nlpodyssey/spago/ag"
  "github.com/nlpodyssey/spago/mat"
)

func main() {
  x := mat.Scalar(-0.8)
  w := mat.Scalar(0.4)
  b := mat.Scalar(-0.2)

  y := Sigmoid(Add(Mul(w, x), b))
  _ = y
}
```

## Performance

Goroutines play a very important role in making Spago efficient; in fact Forward operations are executed concurrently (up to `GOMAXPROCS`). As soon as an Operator is created (usually by calling one of the functions in the `ag` package, such as `Add`, `Prod`, etc.), the related Function's Forward procedure is performed on a new goroutine.
Nevertheless, it's always safe to ask for the Operator's `Value()` without worries: if it's called too soon, the function will lock until the result is computed, and then return the value.

### Known Limits

Sadly, at the moment, Spago is not GPU friendly by design.
